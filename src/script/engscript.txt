[0.00 - 7.08]  Senate Republicans are closing in on a final vote for President Trump's massive tax and
[7.08 - 8.08]  spending bill.
[8.08 - 11.08]  It's been months of tense negotiations and a lot of close calls.
[11.08 - 12.48]  How did they get here?
[12.48 - 19.88]  I'm Michelle Martin, that's Layla Faddle, and this is up first from NPR News.
[19.88 - 24.32]  According to a new poll and overwhelming majority of Americans now say democracy is
[24.32 - 29.24]  under serious threat, and most people from both political parties also say politically
[29.24 - 33.56]  motivated balances a major problem, which is that say about faith and political leaders
[33.56 - 35.68]  and political parties.
[35.68 - 39.84]  And one of the first priorities of the Trump administration was dismantling the United
[39.84 - 42.68]  States Agency for International Development.
[42.68 - 47.24]  Now nearly six months later, USAID is officially shutting down.
[47.24 - 56.00]  Say with us we'll give you the news you need to start your day.
[56.00 - 60.52]  The House of Representatives has approved a White House request to claw back two years
[60.52 - 63.76]  of previously approved funding for public media.
[63.76 - 66.96]  The decisions package now moves on to the Senate.
[66.96 - 72.76]  This move poses a serious threat to local stations and public media as we know it.

[104.08 - 107.64]  Decades ago, Brazilian women made a discovery.
[107.64 - 110.32]  They could have an abortion without a doctor.
[110.32 - 112.60]  Thanks to a tiny pill.
[112.60 - 115.36]  That pill spawns a global movement.
[115.36 - 120.16]  Helping millions of women have safe abortions regardless of the law.

[128.16 - 133.28]  The Republican-led Senate has been in session all night and still going at this hour.
[133.28 - 137.84]  They are debating potential changes to President Trump's massive tax and spending bill.
[137.84 - 141.80]  Senate Republicans are hoping to pass the plan later today, but first they have to take
[141.80 - 146.92]  up a series of amendment votes from both parties that are still going at this hour.
[146.92 - 150.52]  Democrats are fighting the plan's passage, and Senate Republicans still face internal
[150.52 - 156.04]  divisions to get the plan to President Trump's desk by a self-imposed July 4 deadline.
[156.04 - 160.08]  NPR Congressional correspondent Claudio Grosala joins us now to talk about all this good
[160.08 - 161.08]  morning.
[161.08 - 162.08]  Good morning, Leyla.
[162.08 - 167.64]  Okay, so we've seen Republicans consume this year with trying to get this bill passed,
[167.64 - 169.64]  and they're still going.
[169.64 - 170.84]  How did they get here?
[171.16 - 172.16]  Right.
[172.16 - 176.60]  As you mentioned, they've been jockeying all night of vote moments ago, took down a provision
[176.60 - 180.92]  that would have blocked states from regulating artificial intelligence.
[180.92 - 185.76]  But really, when we look at the center of the fight for this legislation, it's focused
[185.76 - 191.48]  on extending tax cuts that were passed during President Trump's first term.
[191.48 - 195.88]  It's going to cost trillions to install, and to pay for it, Republican fiscal hawks want
[195.88 - 198.08]  deep cuts in Medicaid.
[198.08 - 202.04]  This is the health care program used by low income and disabled Americans, and it's
[202.04 - 205.80]  a move more moderate members oppose.
[205.80 - 210.68]  Senate Republican leaders, however, responding to these fiscal hawks, increased the Medicaid
[210.68 - 216.52]  cuts with a new provision that could hurt rural hospitals, and that drew opposition from
[216.52 - 220.64]  a number of Republicans, which is important because Senate Majority Leader John Thune
[220.64 - 224.88]  can only afford to lose three members to get this across the finish line.
[225.12 - 230.28]  Okay, so in its current form, what could this legislation mean for Americans who rely
[230.28 - 231.28]  on Medicaid?
[231.28 - 234.64]  Well, many will be under threat of losing their coverage.
[234.64 - 236.48]  This is a large program.
[236.48 - 238.24]  It's running partnership with states.
[238.24 - 243.08]  It covers more than 70 million Americans, and we know that the nonpartisan congressional
[243.08 - 247.88]  budget office said an estimated 12 million Americans will be forced to lose their health
[247.88 - 251.60]  care insurance under this new Senate version.
[251.60 - 256.28]  And how else could this mega bill impact American lives?
[256.28 - 258.56]  This really is sweeping legislation.
[258.56 - 263.96]  It carries the bulk of President Trump's domestic agenda, and it will touch many facets
[263.96 - 264.96]  of life.
[264.96 - 271.00]  Aside from the tax cuts, there's retaining a current child tax credit level and shorter
[271.00 - 276.68]  term provisions like no tax on tips or overtime pay, and there's new spending for defense as
[276.68 - 279.08]  well as for immigration enforcement.
[279.08 - 284.56]  So for example, boosting efforts along the U.S. Mexico border, and Republicans also want
[284.56 - 289.88]  to spur investments in traditional sources of energy and undo a lot of the climate initiatives
[289.88 - 295.48]  passed as part of former President Biden's inflation reduction act.
[295.48 - 297.24]  So what happens next?
[297.24 - 302.56]  Well, before this can reach Trump's desk, the House will need to sign off on this Senate
[302.56 - 303.56]  version.
[303.56 - 305.92]  There are way on recess, but they've been alerted.
[305.92 - 311.00]  They could be returning as early as Wednesday, assuming the Senate gets this through by then
[311.00 - 315.72]  and get going on this bill to start their voting process all over.
[315.72 - 320.04]  But before they left, Speaker Mike Johnson warned members it's going to take time to keep
[320.04 - 323.04]  their 4th of July plans flexible.
[323.04 - 326.44]  And with all these Senate changes, it's not clear this will be a smooth process in the
[326.44 - 327.44]  House.
[327.44 - 331.00]  We could see fights reemerge over spending versus Medicaid cuts.
[331.00 - 334.12]  But we should note there's some critical deadlines approaching.
[334.12 - 337.84]  There's a provision to lift the debt ceiling by this summer.
[337.84 - 339.64]  That's critical if it doesn't happen.
[339.64 - 343.20]  It could trigger catastrophic financial results.
[343.20 - 344.84]  That's NBR's Claudia Grasales.
[344.84 - 345.84]  Thank you, Claudia.
[345.84 - 346.84]  Thank you.
[346.84 - 357.52]  Ahead of the Independence Day holiday and the country's 249th birthday, three quarters
[357.52 - 361.28]  of Americans say democracy is under serious threat.
[361.28 - 364.92]  That's according to a new poll from NPR, PBS News and Marist.
[364.92 - 370.96]  A similar number also see politically motivated violence as a major problem.
[370.96 - 375.56]  NPR political editor and correspondent, Domenico Montenora is here to talk about these results,
[375.56 - 378.84]  as well as the general atmosphere around politics in this country right now.
[378.84 - 379.84]  Good morning, Domenico.
[379.84 - 380.84]  Hey there.
[380.84 - 383.08]  So let's start with this question about the state of democracy.
[383.08 - 387.00]  What did the poll ask and what stood out to you about the answers?
[387.00 - 391.08]  The overwhelming majority 76% see the country under serious threat.
[391.08 - 397.28]  That includes 89% of Democrats, 80% of independence and 57% of Republicans.
[397.28 - 400.84]  This is coming at a time of great political volatility in the country.
[400.84 - 402.88]  People are polarized and sharply divided.
[402.88 - 407.56]  So in many ways are living in different realities about what they perceive to be the threat,
[407.56 - 410.12]  regardless of who's right or wrong here.
[410.12 - 413.12]  Democrats see Trump and right wing extremism as the threat.
[413.12 - 417.80]  And so we're 31 points more likely to say that there was a serious threat to democracy
[417.80 - 420.16]  when Democrats Joe Biden was president.
[420.16 - 423.68]  So you know, we have to talk about political violence in this country.
[423.68 - 427.84]  There were threats on President Trump's life earlier during the campaign season, two
[427.84 - 428.84]  of them in fact.
[428.84 - 432.76]  And over the weekend, there was a funeral for the state lawmaker and her husband who were
[432.76 - 434.16]  killed in Minnesota.
[434.16 - 436.40]  So how are Americans seeing these attacks?
[436.40 - 442.32]  Yeah, here again, a significant majority 73% said they see politically motivated violence
[442.32 - 444.08]  as a major problem.
[444.08 - 447.84]  While there was little difference by political party, there was some division by race and
[447.84 - 448.84]  age.
[448.84 - 452.84]  Latinos, black voters and younger voters, for example, were less likely to say politically
[452.84 - 457.28]  motivated violence was a major problem as compared to white and older voters.
[457.28 - 461.64]  And one other thing stood out here on both questions, it was white women, regardless
[461.64 - 466.12]  of education level, were most likely to say that there was a serious threat to democracy
[466.12 - 469.24]  and that politically motivated violence was a major problem.
[469.24 - 470.40]  That's interesting.
[470.40 - 472.24]  So given all that, what is the poll?
[472.24 - 474.48]  Tell us about faith in political leaders.
[474.48 - 475.48]  And it's not great.
[475.48 - 479.68]  I mean, people have very low confidence generally in the political leadership in the country
[479.68 - 484.24]  right now, whether it's President Trump, Congressional Republicans or congressional Democrats.
[484.24 - 488.88]  You know, first when it comes to Trump, he gets just a 43% approval.
[488.88 - 493.08]  And when digging down to key specific issue areas, he doesn't score very well on any of
[493.08 - 494.08]  them.
[494.08 - 496.20]  I mean, his handling of immigration is 43%.
[496.20 - 498.36]  Farm policy, just 41%.
[498.36 - 501.24]  And his handling of the economy is worst of all at 39%.
[501.64 - 504.60]  And what about faith in the political parties?
[504.60 - 509.00]  Well, looking at Republicans in Congress, only 35% said they approve of the job they're
[509.00 - 510.00]  doing.
[510.00 - 511.00]  And guess what?
[511.00 - 514.28]  That's the highest that Marist has recorded since it started asking the question back
[514.28 - 516.08]  in 2011.
[516.08 - 519.92]  Democrats, meanwhile, who are hoping to capitalize on Trump's relative unpopularity,
[519.92 - 524.36]  plus the unpopularity of his mega bill that's making its way through Congress, are facing
[524.36 - 529.80]  record lows, just 27% approve of congressional Democrats.
[529.80 - 533.40]  That's their lowest score in seven years back to 2018.
[533.40 - 538.24]  And the reason for that is Democrats themselves, only 44% of Democrats say that they approve
[538.24 - 543.60]  of their party's approach in Congress right now, compare that to 73% of Republicans who
[543.60 - 545.88]  said so of their own party.
[545.88 - 549.52]  If Democrats hope to take back the House next year, they got a lot of work to do to
[549.52 - 551.84]  shore up their own house first.
[551.84 - 553.96]  That is NPR's Dominican Montenegro.
[553.96 - 555.28]  Dominican, thank you.
[555.28 - 556.28]  You're welcome.
[556.28 - 559.60]  And if you want to dive deep into all of the numbers in the poll, they are on our website
[559.60 - 560.60]  NPR.org.
[560.60 - 574.24]  A new study estimates that the US Agency for International Development has helped save
[574.24 - 577.84]  more than 90 million lives in the past two decades.
[577.84 - 580.68]  This on the agency's last official day.
[580.68 - 585.16]  Yes, when the Trump administration took office in January, one of its first major moves
[585.16 - 587.52]  was dismantling USAID.
[587.52 - 591.08]  Today, nearly six months later, the agency officially shuts down.
[591.08 - 595.64]  A few hundred remaining employees will merge their operations under the State Department.
[595.64 - 599.00]  NPR's Fatima Tennis has been covering this and joins us now.
[599.00 - 600.32]  Good morning, Fatima.
[600.32 - 601.32]  Good morning, Lila.
[601.32 - 606.28]  Okay, so tell us what the last days at USAID have been like.
[606.28 - 610.80]  It's been very difficult for an agency staff who have been saying goodbye to their colleagues
[610.80 - 611.80]  last week.
[611.80 - 613.24]  Lots of tears.
[613.24 - 616.40]  People told me it's hitting them that this is the end.
[616.40 - 621.44]  They said they were drawn to the agency's mission, to the idea of helping people in countries
[621.44 - 623.16]  all over the world.
[623.16 - 628.24]  They brought up the USAID logo, which was on everything from clinics to food and medical
[628.24 - 631.80]  packages, the words from the American people.
[631.80 - 634.80]  And that was something staff said they really believed in.
[634.80 - 641.04]  So Fatima, without USAID, is US foreign assistance just something of the past now?
[641.04 - 645.68]  You know, a quick reminder, the US was the largest donor of global health and development
[645.68 - 646.68]  funding.
[646.68 - 650.96]  Much of that was done through USAID, which managed thousands of programs.
[650.96 - 653.72]  More than 80% of them are now terminated.
[653.72 - 659.04]  The administration has decided some will continue and the State Department will take on managing
[659.04 - 660.84]  those starting today.
[660.84 - 662.56]  The administration has made it clear.
[662.56 - 667.28]  It believes most of US foreign aid has not been aligned with President Trump's America
[667.28 - 671.40]  first policy, but it has not outlined a vision for the future.
[671.40 - 675.60]  And what's the impact, bin, of shutting down USAID?
[675.60 - 676.68]  It's hard to overstate.
[676.68 - 680.60]  You know, we're talking about cuts to thousands of programs in low-income countries that
[680.60 - 687.00]  address health issues like malaria and HIV-AIDS, also humanitarian efforts such as feeding
[687.00 - 688.72]  malnourished children.
[688.72 - 692.28]  We also know that the shutting down of programs has caused deaths.
[692.28 - 698.12]  For example, we reported on one child in Nigeria who died because the USAID funded clinic
[698.12 - 701.52]  he went to for urgent medical treatment was shut down.
[701.52 - 704.24]  It was the only clinic nearby.
[704.24 - 708.36]  And you mentioned earlier that study published in the Lancet, it projects that the cuts to
[708.36 - 714.12]  USAID could result in 14 million preventable deaths by 2030.
[714.12 - 718.32]  And while much of the impact has been felt globally, there's concern in academic circles
[718.32 - 722.04]  and in Congress that there will be consequences felt here at home.
[722.04 - 724.04]  And what are those consequences?
[724.04 - 728.88]  So this actually came up at a hearing last week, Senator's question Russell vote about
[728.88 - 730.68]  the cuts to foreign assistance.
[730.68 - 734.36]  He's a director of the Office of Management and Budget for the White House.
[734.36 - 738.44]  Several Republicans brought up that foreign assistance served two purposes.
[738.44 - 742.32]  It helped prevent diseases from reaching the United States.
[742.32 - 747.36]  And also something called soft power where you spend money to build positive relationships
[747.36 - 750.08]  and create stability in the world.
[750.08 - 753.00]  There's a Republican Senator Mitch McConnell talking about it.
[753.00 - 759.96]  Over my years in Senate, the biggest supporters of soft power run into the military generals
[759.96 - 766.76]  who are fully aware of how much more costly it is to have a war than to prevent one.
[766.76 - 771.48]  McConnell went on to say that he also didn't like all of USAID's programs, but that the
[771.48 - 776.80]  way the administration had gone after them had been quote, unnecessarily chaotic and created
[776.80 - 781.16]  opportunities for China to fill the gap the US has left.
[781.16 - 782.16]  That's NPR's Fadmintonis.
[782.16 - 784.16]  Thank you, Fadminton.
[784.16 - 793.16]  Thank you.
[793.16 - 796.12]  We end today's episode with Zohran Mamdani.
[796.12 - 800.30]  It's a name most people hadn't heard of just a year ago, even in his home state of New
[800.30 - 803.00]  York where he's been serving in the state assembly.
[803.00 - 807.56]  And so when Mamdani announced his candidacy for New York City mayor last October, it's
[807.56 - 810.36]  fair to say most people didn't think he had a chance.
[810.36 - 813.40]  He is a Democratic Socialist just 33 years old.
[813.40 - 818.16]  He's a Muslim of Indian descent and he did not have the backing of his party's establishment.
[818.16 - 822.52]  The editorial board of the New York Times urged voters not to vote for him, citing inexperience
[822.52 - 825.32]  and what they considered pie in the sky proposals.
[825.32 - 829.76]  While Mamdani has kept affordability at the center of his campaign, others tried to
[829.76 - 835.08]  define his identity with claims he would promote Islamic law, that he supports terrorism,
[835.08 - 836.48]  and that he's an anti-Semite.
[836.48 - 840.60]  I think there are a lot of concerns that are based upon a caricature of myself.
[840.60 - 844.68]  And I don't blame New Yorkers for having that caricature because they've had to deal
[844.68 - 849.68]  with more than 30 million dollars of spending that paints me in that manner, that smears
[849.68 - 855.80]  and slanders me, that artificially lengthens the color and the length of my beard, that
[855.80 - 858.52]  calls me a monster and describes me at the gates.
[858.52 - 862.84]  If I was someone who knew nothing about myself and that was the only way that I was introduced
[862.84 - 866.12]  to a campaign, I too might have concerns.
[866.12 - 868.48]  New Yorkers for the most part didn't buy it.
[868.48 - 872.44]  Mamdani became the presumptive winner of the Democratic primary last week and is now
[872.44 - 876.12]  one step closer to becoming mayor of the nation's largest city.
[876.12 - 879.80]  I sat down with him on Monday in New York City and asked him what his party's leaders
[879.80 - 882.08]  can learn from his campaign.
[882.08 - 886.04]  You can hear more from my conversation with Zaharan Mamdani on Morning Edition, turn
